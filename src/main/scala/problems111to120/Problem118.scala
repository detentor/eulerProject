//Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to 
//form decimal integers, different sets can be formed. 
//Interestingly with the set {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.
//
//How many distinct sets containing each of the 
//digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?

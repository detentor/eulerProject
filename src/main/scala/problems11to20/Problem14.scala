//The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
//n ->  n/2 (n is even)
//n ->  3n + 1 (n is odd)
//Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
//13  40  20  10  5  16  8  4  2  1
//It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. 
//Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
//Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
//NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
